   4. Upload or create a new .md file with the name `index.md`
   5. Add the following YAML frontmatter to the top of the file to match your data

   ```
   title: "Example Title"
   last_updated: 2022-07-14 11:23:21 +0100
   description: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
   ```

   5. Below the frontmatter, add content for your post.
   6. If you want to add images to your post, save them in the folder that contains your new index.md file and reference the images in the format
      `![Image Description](./image.png "Image Description")`
