   4. Navigate into the folder you have just created or repeat the previous step.
   5. Upload or create a new .md file using 'Add file' button
   6. Name the new post in the format index.md
   7. Add the following YAML frontmatter to the top of the file

   ```
   layout: post
   title: "Example Title"
   last_updated: 2022-07-14 11:23:21 +0100
   description: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
   priority: 1
   ```

   5. Below the frontmatter, add content for your post.
   6. If you want to add images to your post, save them in the folder that contains your new index.md file and reference the images in the format
      `![Image Description]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/async-py.png "Image Description")`

   ## Modifying the overview page

   1. Both parent categories have an Overview page, the index.md files can be accessed directly from the first layer folder within content. For example: `content/documentation/index.md`
